# Hackerrank-Code-Submission

Hi, In this Project I used automation for submitting codes of problems in hackerrank.

It is done using puppeteer and promises.

First It'll go to hackerrank website and then go to Interview Preparation Kit.

Then it will select the problem page and then it'll submit the codes one by one by taking it from the editorial page of problem.
